Welcome to Sense-Able. This project is designed to be usable by deafblind people to enhance their ability to communicate with others. A series of vibrations are utilised to translate text into detectable patterns to convey individual Braille or Morse characters, depending on the user's settings. Also featured is a way for users to save emergency phrases which can be spoken out loud by text-to-speech should they need assistance, as well as a translator from text into Deafblind Manual sign language.

This is compatible with Android only.
